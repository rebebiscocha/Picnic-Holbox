## Kickoff
With your guidance, I'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
Please note that I'll only request specific code snippets as we progress,
so there's no need to provide code until I explicitly ask for it.
Are you ready to start?

## HTML Structure
Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
It should have the following sections: a header, a section for 
displaying my projects, an about section, and a section for
showcasing my skills. Also, include a footer.

Please add these sections as placeholders for now, as we will be coding 
them and filling them out step by step.

## Header and Navigation
Please code an HTML header displaying my name, "Guil H," and navigation
links for the sections: projects, about, and skills.

## About Section
Now guide me to create the HTML for the about section. It should include
my picture, a friendly introduction, and a link to my resume.

## Skills Section
Now let's code the HTML for my skills section. 

Letâ€™s start with the skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 
Each skill should have a name and a description. I also want to display
a progress bar representing my proficiency in each skill.

## Footer
Create the HTML for the page footer. It should contain copyright information
and links to my LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram profiles. Please use
icon fonts to display a social media icon for each link.

## CSS Layout and Design
Next, design a simple modern CSS layout for my homepage. 
The layout should be responsive to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

I prefer a black-and-white color scheme and sans-serif fonts. 

Make my picture smaller and rounded. Please add generous line height
and visual space around the content.

<!-- 
  Challenge: Add content containers 
    * Use a prompt to ask ChatGPT how to create
      containers for each section
    * Add the suggested CSS to the project
    * Update the HTML with containers for the 
      Projects, About, and Skills sections
-->

## Site containers
Please suggest how to create containers for my site's content. Here is an example of a section of my page where I want a `.container` class only to control the width and alignment of the "About" content:

```
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="My picture">
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
  </div>
</section>
```
